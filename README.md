## Abstract
This project explores how AI can be used to detect and analyze bias in Wikipedia content. Drawing from prior research on structural, gender, and representation biases, it examines how biased language appears, evolves, or is corrected over time. Using Wikipedia's text and edit histories, the study applies word embeddings, metadata analysis, and simple bias detection tools to trace patterns of bias across articles and topics. A key focus is on how AI-assisted editing impacts the persistence or reduction of these biases, and whether community revisions help mitigate or unintentionally reinforce them. This research aims to inform more equitable and transparent use of AI in collaborative knowledge platforms.


## Research Questions
How does AI-assisted editing influence the introduction and persistence of bias in Wikipedia, and what patterns show whether community revisions reduce or reinforce these biases?
